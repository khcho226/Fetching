## Introduction
This is an android application for user who wants to get recommendations from someone.
1. The recommedations are done by AI.
2. Users who use the app can just take pictures and upload them or bring them from the gallery.
3. Users can receive recommendations only with information such as color, category, length, and fit, even if they do not have clothes they have.
4. However, the difference between other recommendation systems and this app is that users can receive recommendations for **THEIR** clothes.
